# DOM-Etch-A-Sketch

I created this as a side project during my early exploration of web development. It served as a fun and creative way to showcase my DOM manipulation skills, adding a unique entry to my portfolio. Essentially, I designed a web-based toy, resembling a hybrid between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch, to combine both fun and learning in my journey into web development.

This project is a straightforward yet effective display tool, generating a grid based on user input. By specifying the desired number, the application generates a grid with 'x' number of boxes in both the horizontal and vertical directions. It offers a simple and interactive way to explore grid-based structures and serves as an excellent showcase of my web development skills.
